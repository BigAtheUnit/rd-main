    excerpt: "Generative AI can transform your workflow — but only if you choose the right tool. Here's how to select the best option for your organisation.",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">With dozens of AI tools now available, choosing the right one for your organisation can feel overwhelming. Whether you're a charity looking to create campaign content or a small business streamlining operations, the right generative AI tool can save time, increase productivity, and improve consistency.</p>
      
      <p>Here's how to navigate the growing market and find an AI solution that truly fits your needs.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Define Your Core Use Case</h2>
      <p>Start by asking: what do you want AI to do for you? Common use cases include:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Content generation (e.g. blogs, emails, social media posts)</li>
        <li>Customer support (e.g. chatbots)</li>
        <li>Document summarisation</li>
        <li>Translation and transcription</li>
        <li>Automation of repetitive tasks</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If you need help with multiple areas, consider whether one platform can handle them all or if you'll need a suite of tools.</p>

      <h2>2. Consider Your Sector's Requirements</h2>
      <p>Different industries have different needs:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Charities may benefit from tools that offer free or discounted plans and prioritise GDPR compliance.</li>
        <li>Public sector organisations need transparency and accessibility features.</li>
        <li>Education providers should look for AI that supports learning, not shortcuts.</li>
        <li>Businesses might prioritise scalability and integration with CRM or analytics.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For specific AI applications in the charity sector, our article on <a href="/blog/top-5-ai-tools-charities-nonprofits-2025">top AI tools transforming charities and nonprofits</a> provides tailored recommendations.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Look at Integration and Ease of Use</h2>
      <p>The best AI tool is the one your team will actually use. Choose platforms with:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Clean, user-friendly interfaces</li>
        <li>Strong support and documentation</li>
        <li>API access or plugins for your existing systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Think About Ethics and Privacy</h2>
      <p>Generative AI works by learning from data. Make sure your tool:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Follows UK data privacy laws</li>
        <li>Offers clear data handling policies</li>
        <li>Has controls to avoid bias and hallucination</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> favour tools with transparent training sources.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Test Before You Commit</h2>
      <p>Many tools offer free trials — use them! Create a short pilot project and get feedback from your team.</p>
      
      <p>Compare:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Output quality</li>
        <li>Ease of collaboration</li>
        <li>Value for money</li>
      </ul>

    excerpt: "Cybersecurity isn't just IT's problem — it's a brand strength. Learn how protecting your digital presence builds customer trust.",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">Trust is one of your most valuable assets online — and strong cybersecurity is key to earning it. With cyberattacks on the rise, your users want to know their data is safe.</p>
      
      <p>Here's how cybersecurity supports brand trust and customer loyalty.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Secure Websites = Confident Visitors</h2>
      <p>From SSL certificates to secure payment gateways, visible signs of safety (like the padlock icon) give users confidence in your platform.</p>

      <h2>2. Data Protection Shows Professionalism</h2>
      <p>Clearly stating your GDPR compliance, cookie policy, and data handling procedures sends the message that your organisation is transparent and responsible.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Fast Response Builds Loyalty</h2>
      <p>If a breach occurs, how you respond can make or break your reputation. A clear incident response plan and customer comms protocol are essential.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Cybersecurity Can Be a Selling Point</h2>
      <p>Highlight your cybersecurity policies as part of your pitch — especially if you handle sensitive or financial data. It can give you the edge over competitors.</p>
      
      <p>Security works hand-in-hand with accessibility to create truly inclusive websites. Learn why <a href="/blog/accessibility-foundation-website-design">accessibility should be the foundation</a> of your website design to complement your security measures.</p>
      
      <p>For public sector organizations where both security and accessibility are critical legal requirements, our guide on <a href="/blog/digital-strategy-public-sector-2025-trends">digital strategy trends for the public sector</a> provides a comprehensive approach.</p>
