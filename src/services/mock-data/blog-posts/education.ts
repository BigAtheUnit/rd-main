    title: "Is Your School's Website Letting You Down? 7 Signs It's Time for a Redesign",
    slug: "school-website-redesign-signs",
    excerpt: "From clunky navigation to poor mobile usability — here's how to tell if your school website needs a redesign in 2025.",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">Your website is the digital front door of your school — and in 2025, parents, students, and Ofsted expect more than just term dates and photos.</p>
      
      <p>Here are seven warning signs your website might be letting you down.</p>
      
      <h2>1. It's Not Mobile-Friendly</h2>
      <p>Most parents now use their phones to access school info. If your site isn't responsive, you're frustrating your audience and losing credibility.</p>

      <h2>2. Important Info is Hard to Find</h2>
      <p>School websites should be simple and intuitive. Key items like lunch menus, contact forms, policies and newsletters should never be more than a few clicks away.</p>
      
      <h2>3. The Design Looks Dated</h2>
      <p>An outdated design can give the impression of a school that's behind the times — even if that's far from the truth. A fresh, modern layout builds trust and pride.</p>
      
      <h2>4. You're Not Meeting Accessibility Standards</h2>
      <p>Inclusion is a must. If your site doesn't meet WCAG 2.1 standards, you could be excluding users with visual impairments or learning difficulties.</p>
      
      <p>For a deeper dive into why <a href="/blog/accessibility-foundation-website-design">accessibility should be the foundation</a> of your website design rather than an afterthought, check out our comprehensive guide.</p>
      
      <h2>5. There's No Easy Way to Update It</h2>
      <p>A good content management system (CMS) empowers staff to update pages easily. If you rely on a developer for every tweak, it's time for a change.</p>
      
      <h2>6. It Doesn't Reflect Your Ethos</h2>
      <p>Your values should shine through in the design, imagery, and language. If it feels generic, it won't engage your community.</p>
      
      <h2>7. It's Slow or Unreliable</h2>
      <p>Performance issues lead to higher bounce rates and parent frustration. Speed matters.</p>
      
      <p>Looking to integrate modern digital tools into your school's strategy beyond just the website? Our article on <a href="/blog/ai-educational-institutions-guide">implementing AI in educational institutions</a> offers practical guidance for schools ready to take the next step.</p>

    content: `
      <p class="lead">Educational institutions across the UK are exploring artificial intelligence to enhance teaching, streamline administration, and improve student outcomes. But implementing AI requires careful planning, ethical considerations, and appropriate governance.</p>
      
      <p>This guide outlines practical steps for education leaders considering AI adoption.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Personalized learning pathways for students</li>
        <li>Automated grading and feedback for routine assessments</li>
        <li>Early identification of students needing additional support</li>

      <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>Educational AI implementations must prioritize:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data privacy and security</li>
        <li>Algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation</li>
        <li>Transparency in decision-making</li>
        <li>Human oversight and intervention</li>
        <li>Digital inclusion and accessibility</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>As you consider AI adoption, our article on <a href="/blog/choose-right-generative-ai-tool-workplace">choosing the right generative AI tool for your workplace</a> provides additional guidance specific to educational settings.</p>
      
      <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
      <p>A phased approach works best for educational institutions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with a focused pilot project</li>
        <li>Gather stakeholder input (students, teachers, parents)</li>
        <li>Establish clear success metrics</li>
        <li>Provide adequate training and support</li>
        <li>Regularly review outcomes and adjust accordingly</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Governance Framework</h2>
      <p>Effective AI governance includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear policies on data usage and retention</li>
        <li>Regular ethical reviews</li>
        <li>Risk assessment procedures</li>
        <li>Mechanisms for addressing concerns</li>
        <li>Compliance with education-specific regulations</li>
      </ul>
